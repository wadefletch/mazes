# ðŸ§© Maze Generation in Python

This python script generates mazes using recursive backtracing, solves them with one of a couple methods and then outputs a nice lil' GIF or in the terminal.

## Usage
### GIF with solution (same as preview above)
```python
from mazes import Maze

m = Maze(200 + 1, 200 + 1, save_gif=True)
m.shortest_path(method="dijkstra")
```
*Told you it was bad.*

### Output to terminal
```python
from mazes import Maze

m = Maze(200 + 1, 200 + 1)
m.print()
```

## Opportunities for Improvement
- Multithreading (GIF generation is super slow)
- Add generation algorithms other than backtracing
  - [Randomized Prim's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Prim's_algorithm)
  - [Randomized Kruskal's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Randomized_Kruskal's_algorithm)
  - [Something Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Cellular_automaton_algorithms) would be super cool
- GIF generation refactoring (relevant code is concise but not nicely OOP'ed)
- Better comments (as always)
